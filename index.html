        <p>An Indian passport is issued by the Ministry of External Affairs of the Republic of India to Indian citizens for the purpose of international travel. It enables the bearer to travel internationally and serves as proof of Indian citizenship as per the Passports Act (1967). The Passport Seva (Passport Service) unit of the Consular, Passport & Visa (CPV) Division of the Ministry of External Affairs functions as the issuing authority and is responsible for issuing Indian passports on application to all eligible Indian citizens. Indian passports are issued at 93 passport offices located across India and at 197 Indian diplomatic missions abroad.[2]

            In 2015, India issued about 12 million passports, a number exceeded only by China and the United States.[3] Approximately 65 million Indians held valid passports as of the end of 2015.[3]</p>
            Contemporary ordinary Indian passports have deep bluish cover with golden coloured printing. The Emblem of India is emblazoned in the centre of the front cover. The words "भारत गणराज्य" in Devanagari and "Republic of India" are inscribed below the Emblem whereas "पासपोर्ट" in Devanagari and "Passport" in English are inscribed above the emblem. The standard passport contains 36 pages, but frequent travellers can opt for a passport containing 60 pages. Some early passports were handwritten, including some issued between 1997 and 2000 with 20-year validity dates. These passports have been ruled invalid by the Indian government and holders must replace them with machine-readable versions good for 10 years due to ICAO regulations.[12]
